I learned course English for STEM (science, technology, engineering and math).

?During this course I studied some grammatic and vocalbulary. 
Main topic of this course was change of climate of the Earth. There tells why it's happening, how we impacts on it and how it impacts on the Earth, consequencies of climate changes and tells about technologies that are able to lessen these effects.

This course have 5 units:
In unit 1 we tried to answer the question is the Earth getting harmer and why
In unit 2 we found out about greenhouse effect and factors that supports it
In unit 3 we found out about factors that impacts on global warming and consequencies of climate changes
In unit 4 we found about renewable sources of energy, new ecological standarts and technologies for getting green energy
In last unit we found out about modern techologies that lesses greenhouse effect

During this course I did test by topics of units, vocalbulary and grammatics and wrote some articles.

There I found out about 
 - adwises how to analize scientific articles
 - impact of global warming on ecosystems, humans nutrition
 - indian solar trees
 - turning carbon dioxyde into stone
 - vertical farming
 - artificial photosyntesis systems based  on nanotechnologies and bacterias.

Summarizing I can say that this course is useful for learning some technical terms, grammatic and reading scientific articles
